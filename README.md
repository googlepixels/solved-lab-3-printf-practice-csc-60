<strong>Problem</strong>:

Practice writing printf statements.

You will write several printf statements to achieve the results below, including the line spacing.  There is no room for creativity in this assignment. I want you to be able to control your print output to a specification. Use the quote that is given below.

<em>Start your code with (Approximate the number of dashes): </em>

<strong>                             </strong><strong>/*————–*/</strong>

<strong>/* Your Name    */</strong>

<strong>/* Lab 3        */</strong>

<strong>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</strong>

<strong>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</strong>

<strong>int main(void)</strong>

<strong>{         int age = 22;    </strong><em>// You must use this variable </em><strong>        double average = 246.23689;</strong>

<ul>

 <li>Obviously, your output (shown below) will not say <strong>bielr</strong> on it.</li>

 <li>I want the line spacing just as it appears below.</li>

 <li>Yes, you may move the starting brace to the end of the line above if you desire.</li>

 <li><strong>Write one printf for each line that appears below</strong>.</li>

 <li>Regarding the quote and its attribution, you may do it in either one or two printf statements.</li>

 <li>Do <strong>not</strong> use a different quote for this assignment.</li>

 <li>When printing the friend’s age, write the printf so it will only print 2 digits.</li>

 <li>When printing <strong>average</strong>, you <strong>must</strong> use both a <em><u>total  width </u></em> and the <em><u>after-the-decimal-point value</u></em> in your conversion specifier.</li>

 <li>Remember to print your name and “Lab 3” in the output.</li>

</ul>

<strong>Output:</strong>

Ruthann Biel. Lab 3.

Jane went to the store.

My friend is 22 years old.

The average = 246.2

The average = 246.237

The average = 2.46e+02

<strong>Preparing your work for grading:</strong>

When all is well and correct, type:  <strong>script StudentName_lab3.txt   </strong>Script will keep a log of your session. type:  <strong>gcc lab3.c            </strong>to compile the program. type:  <strong>a.out </strong>to run the program. type: <strong>exit         </strong>to leave the session.

PS:  If you don’t type <strong>exit</strong> to leave your script session,

you will end up with an empty file.

<strong><u>Turn in your completed session.</u></strong>

Go to Canvas and turn in two files:

<ol>

 <li>c</li>

 <li>txt</li>

</ol>

Worth 14 points.

<strong><u>Reading Assignment:</u></strong>

Read the Power Point files named <strong>C-3 ControlStructures</strong> and <strong>C-4 Loops</strong>

Mostly you will all know the concepts of the material. You just need to pay attention to “how to spell it”.  I will give everyone a few points for this.  There is nothing to turn in.

You should have read these before you start on Lab 4.
